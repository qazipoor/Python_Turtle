# 🐢 Python Turtle Graphics Project

A fun Python project built using the **Turtle** graphics library.  
This project demonstrates how to create shapes, patterns, and visual effects using Python’s built-in **turtle** module — perfect for learning loops, functions, and RGB color manipulation.

---

## 🎨 Features
- 🟥 Draw multiple shapes:
  - Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Heptagon, Octagon, Nonagon, and Decagon
- 🌈 Generate **random RGB colors**
- 🐾 Create **random walks** with dynamic colors and directions
- 🟢 Draw **dashed lines**
- 🌀 Generate mesmerizing **spirograph** patterns
- 💡 All created using Python’s built-in **turtle** library — no external dependencies

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qazipoor/Python_Turtle.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Python_Turtle
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python draw_spirograph.py
   ```
4.  Run the script:
   ```bash
   python draw_shapes.py
  ```
5. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python random_walk.py
   ```
6. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python draw_dashed_line.py
   ```

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
This project is great for beginners learning Python!  
You’ll explore:
- **Loops & functions**
- **RGB color tuples** and the `turtle.colormode()` function
- **Random module** for color and movement generation
- **Turtle graphics commands** like `forward()`, `right()`, `circle()`, `penup()`, and `pendown()`
- **Modular coding** by organizing each drawing functionality into separate functions

## 🖥️ Demo Preview

Example of some of the patterns you can draw:

```
▶ Drawing shapes...
▶ Drawing a random walk...
▶ Drawing a spirograph...
```

After running, you’ll see the turtle window open and start drawing vibrant, animated shapes and patterns — each time with new random colors!
